            <p>Star Wars is a multi-genre mythology and multimedia franchise created by George Lucas in 1976. Comprising movies, novels, comics, video games, toys, and numerous television series, the Star Wars franchise employs archetypal motifs common to religions, classical mythology, and political climax, as well as musical motifs of those same aspects.

                As one of the foremost examples of the space opera subgenre of science fiction, Star Wars has become part of mainstream popular culture, as well as being one of the highest-grossing series of all time.[1]
                
                In 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought the rights to the franchise from George Lucas for 4.05 billion dollars. Since then, Disney has split off Star Wars into two main categories, those being Star Wars Legends and Star Wars Canon, with Canon being the "official" story of the franchise.
                
                Despite the mainline story of the franchise, officially known as the Skywalker Saga, reaching its conclusion in 2019 with the release of Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker, the franchise is still going strong, mainly due to the success of the Disney+ original television series The Mandalorian, the final season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars and publishing projects such as Star Wars: The High Republic.

            <p>As a Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi was the headstrong apprentice to Qui-Gon Jinn. The two were dispatched to settle a dispute between the Trade Federation and the planet Naboo, but negotiations never took place -- the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, orchestrating the Trade Federation’s blockade of the planet, ordered the Jedi killed. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon survived the trap, however, and fled to the planet’s surface. There, they finally connected with Queen Padmé Amidala of the Naboo, fled the planet, and landed on Tatooine. Qui-Gon and Padmé crossed paths with a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who was unusually strong with the Force, helping the stranded heroes pay for starship parts by winning a Podrace. Anakin and Obi-Wan met for the first time after a near-deadly attack by a mysterious dark warrior, and the group headed home to Coruscant. In a surprise move, Queen Amidala decided to go back to Naboo to retake the planet, with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon escorting her. Little did they know that the dark menace from Tatooine, in truth a Sith named Darth Maul, was awaiting their arrival. The two Jedi dueled Maul in a fast, furious battle, which saw Qui-Gon fatally wounded. Obi-Wan continued the fight, but a Force push left him dangling above a deep shaft. Maul toyed with him, kicking Obi-Wan’s lightsaber into the abyss, but could not anticipate the Jedi’s bold move: he somersaulted over Maul, drew Qui-Gon’s Jedi weapon to his hand, and cut the Sith Lord in two. Kenobi ran to Qui-Gon, who with his dying wish asked Obi-Wan to train Anakin as a Jedi. And so it was: the Council granted Obi-Wan knighthood, and Anakin was named his Padawan.</p>
